        <h4>We take your privacy seriously. This statement outlines how we handle your data.</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>1.</strong> We will never sell your data.<br>
            <strong>2.</strong> We will not share your data with third parties.<br>
            <strong>3.</strong> Our bot will not collect your data; except for some that is collected by OpenAI.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> We follow all these practices listed; but OpenAI (Owner of ChatGPT) might collect
            data to improve services. This is not in our control.
